# ShieldIO

A simple CLI tool to download raster "shields" from [shields.io](https://shields.io) 

This tool basically calls https://raster.shields.io/badge/{main text}-{sub text}-orange and downloads the resulting PNG to the current directory, making it quick and simple to generate simple "shield" badges
